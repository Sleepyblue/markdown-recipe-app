## Description 

<br>

 A markdown-based recipe application (some syntax inspired by [Cooklang](https://github.com/cooklang/cooklang-ts)) that tries to tone-down recipe management to the absolute essential by being focused on text files, allowing for all the modern interactivity we're used to and other advanced features, while making use of a clean and pleasant user interface (I hope!) to manage your personal recipe database. 
 Some highlights from this management approach are:
 - Markdown is portable,  platform independent and future proof;
 - The text-based recognition syntax is easy to get a handle of so the base file is kept as human-readable as possible;
 - Note-down a recipe anywhere! Just open any text editor, anywhere, note it using the syntax and import it to the application at a later date;
 - The recipe information can be saved as a file and managed locally, avoiding databases (as of now the application still uses the `localStorage`);

The project makes use of HTML, SCSS and JavaScript using the MVC architecture. The used bundler is Vite.

## How to Use the Project?

>*Updated as development progresses*

<br>

- To enter an ingredient use `@ingredient`for a single worded ingredient or `@long ingredient_` for multiple words ingredients. 
>**EXAMPLE:** Slice an @apple and use @soft butter_ to cook.
	
- To enter a unit-less quantity for that ingredient use `@ingredient_(Num)` or `@long ingredient_(Num)`
>**EXAMPLE:** Slice @apple_(6) and use @soft butter_(1) to cook. 

- To enter a quantity with units associated to it use `@ingredient_(Num&Unit)` or `@long ingredient_(Num&Unit)`
>**EXAMPLE:** Slice @apple_(500&grams) and use @soft butter_(150&grams) to cook. 

- To identify any cookware use `#cookware` or `#long cookware_`
>**EXAMPLE:** Slice @apple_(500&grams) and use @soft butter_(150&grams). Cook it on and #oven using an #iron skillet_ 

- Each `\n` (line break) is considered a step. Simply press 'ENTER' to go to a new line and add a new step.
>**EXAMPLE:**<br>
>Slice @apple_(500&grams) and use @soft butter_(150&grams). *(STEP 1)* <br>
>Cook it on and #oven using an #iron skillet_ *STEP 2)*
